# NHLGamePredictor
Predicts point outcome of NHL matchup based on previous 20 games (2 points for win, 1 point for ot/so loss, 0 points for regulation loss).

Currently trained with all games from Sep 2005 to Nov 30, 2018 minus 20 games. Tried those 20 games as test set with only 35% success rate. Needs improvements, as barely above the 33% random outcome for predictions.
